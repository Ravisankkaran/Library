The central figure in the story is Frodo Baggins, a humble hobbit who is chosen to bear the Ring and carry out the dangerous mission.
              
              Throughout their journey, Frodo and his companions, including the loyal Samwise Gamgee, encounter various races and creatures, such as elves, dwarves, wizards, and the noble race of men.
